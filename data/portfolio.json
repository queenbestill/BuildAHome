I'm Patricia, an English teacher and creative based in Lisbon.\n\nAfter years of moving between temporary homes, I dream of a place to call my own.\n\nLisbon's housing prices have made that dream hard to reach.\n\nThis campaign helps fund a down payment and essential legal costs.\n\nEvery euro goes directly toward a stable, peaceful home.\n\nFrom there, I can teach, create, and share work with more heart.\n\nI'll post transparent updates: progress, photos, and milestones.\n\nIf you can't donate, sharing the campaign already helps a lot.\n\nThank you for walking this path with me.",
